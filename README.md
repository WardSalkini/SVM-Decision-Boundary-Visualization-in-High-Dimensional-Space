# SVM-Decision-Boundary-Visualization-in-High-Dimensional-Space
This project demonstrates advanced techniques for visualizing SVM decision boundaries in high-dimensional datasets by reducing them to 3D space. The implementation handles both linear and non-linear kernels using different mathematical approaches.
